# this program demonstrates the use of for loop in python. It will print the even numbers from 10 to 30,
#  the natural numbers from 1 to 20 and the sum of first 20 natural numbers using for loop.

 
# simple loop to print even numbers from 10 to 30

for n in range(10,30,4):
    print(n*2,end=",")

# natural numbers from 1 to 20
for n in range(1,21):
     print(n,end=",")

# sum of natural numbers

#initializing sum variable equal to 0
Sum = 0
for n in range(1,21):  
    Sum += n
print("sum of first 20 natural numbers : ",Sum)



'''output:


# simple loop results
